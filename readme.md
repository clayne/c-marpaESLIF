This is the readme file of the Lua Template Engine

# Overview
A Lua module for the evaluation of textual templates, for example to support
code generation.

Using a special syntax, templates can refer to _any valid Lua expression_ which
must be defined _in the environment passed to the evaluation function_.
Arbitrary Lua code can also be intertwined with the text.

Below is a representative example. For more simple examples, please see
`src/sample/sample.lua`.

```Lua
local tpleval = require('template-text').template_eval

local tpl = [[
Hi! This is a text template!
It can reference any symbol which is defined in the environment (i.e. a table)
given to the evaluation function:

Hello $(name) for $(many(5)) times!

Actual Lua code can be used in the template, starting the line with a '@':
@ for k,v in pairs( aTable ) do
key: $(k)    value: $(v)
@ end
]]

local dummyF = function(i) return i*3 end
local dummyT = {"bear", "wolf", "shark", "monkey"}

local ok, text = tpleval(tpl,
  { name   = "Marco",
    many   = dummyF,
    aTable = dummyT}
)
if not ok then
  print("ERROR: " .. text) -- in this case text would be an error message
else
  print(text)
end
```

Running this sample with
```
cd src/sample
lua fromreadme.lua
```
should produce the following output:
```
Hi! This is a text template!
It can reference any symbol which is defined in the environment (i.e. a table)
given to the evaluation function:

Hello Marco for 15 times!

Actual Lua code can be used in the template, starting the line with a '@':
key: 1    value: bear
key: 2    value: wolf
key: 3    value: shark
key: 4    value: monkey

```


# Installing
From the root of the repository, type (requires LuaRocks):

```
luarocks --local make
```

Before running a script that uses the module, you might need:
```
eval `luarocks path`
```

# Dependencies

The template engine does not depend on any other module. Lua > 5.1 is required.
