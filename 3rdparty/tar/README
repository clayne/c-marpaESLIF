PCRE2 is pre-lqtched by hand outside of the build process.

This has to be done in a UNIX shell.
Tarballs must be in the .tar.gz format.
It is ASSUMED that all tarballs extracts first and only a top directory, because patch is applied with the p1 option.

Usage is:

patchit.sh source dest patchdir

where:
- source is assume to refer to a file source.tar.gz that exist.
- dest will be created as dest.tar.gz, and have to be known to CMakeLists.txt + CMakeObjects.PL
- patchdir contains a list of patches, executed in alphabetic order

Example:

./patchit.sh ./pcre2-10.42.tar.gz ./pcre2-10.42-patched.tar.gz ./pcre2-10.42.patchdir
